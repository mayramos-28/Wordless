## Project template for lintering
- Put your files into `src` directory
- Run the linter with `yarn eslint`
- If you want to run the linter for a single file, use `yarn eslint <FILE.JS>`

If you're using windows, you'll need to use `yarn winlint src`. All files under `src` directory will be processed.
